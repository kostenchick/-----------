            Proteins are <span class="fw-bold">large</span>, complex molecules
            that play many critical roles in the body. They do most of the work
            in cells and are required for the structure, function, and <br />
            regulation of the body's tissues and organs.

            <span>energy</span> compound that supplementation can increase to
            improve performance. Creatine (Cr) is a naturally occurring amino
            compound found <br />
            in skeletal, cardiac, smooth muscle, and brain that plays an
            indispensable role in energy metabolism in almost all tissues.

          <p>
            BCAA is a general term for the essential amino acids valine,
            leucine, and isoleucine that are
            <span class="fw-bold">metabolized by the body</span> and used as
            sources of muscle energy.<br />
            They are referred to as
            <span class="fw-bold">Branched Chain Amino Acids</span> because the
            molecular structure of these three amino acids includes branches
